Load Balancer: For distribution of incoming traffic

Another swever: To prevent crashing juat in case there is ovwrloading because of bulky inciming traffic

What distribution algorithm is your load balancer configured with?
Active-Active
That's because it uses one load balancer which distributes all the incoming traffic to the servers.

Differences:
In Active-Active the incoming traffic is distributed across serveers by a main load balancer while in Active-Passive, the user machines are connected to a main load balancer which handles all the incoming while a backup load balancer (monitors performance of the main) is on standby in case of a service outage.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
It enables data from one database server (the master) to the replicated one or more database servers (the slaves)

-What is the difference between the primary node and the Replica node in regards to the application?


ISSUES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE
-Where are SPOF
If the servers reside in the same data center, then any outage like power would cause dysfunction.
If the primary MySQL database server is down, the entire site would be unable to make changes to the site.

The server containing the load balancer and application server connecting to the primary database server are also SPOFs...

- Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
It is using http which is not secure as data is being transferred without being encrypted.
It lacks firewall, meaning any incoming traffic has access to the data.

- No monitoring
There is no monitoring being done, we don't know whether our wev is online, working fast, returning error everytime or monitoring requests.
