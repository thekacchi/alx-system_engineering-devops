ISSUES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

-SPOF
This can be seen with the client software or hardware, the network connection or with a single server therefore malfunction in its hardware or software or even issues in the data center can cause the entire system to fail.

- Downtime maintenance is needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
Downtime when it is updating requires for the whole system to shutdown, at this time, users will not be able to access the services because there is no other server that can take its place.

- Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
It is using a single server that can be overloaded with incoming bulky traffic that can cause server crashing. There is no real scalability, since we don't have another server
